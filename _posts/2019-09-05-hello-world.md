I set up this using Jekyll. Don't know how I'll go about adding comments....

Othwerise, Jekyll seems like a good and flexible solution for me :)

That is, it supports the following:

- Markdown
- Syntax highlighting
- HTML when needed
- Images
- Statically generated and can be hosted on github-pages for free
